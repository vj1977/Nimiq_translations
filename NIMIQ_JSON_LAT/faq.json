         "question": "What are NIM?",
         "answer": "NIM is the token of the Nimiq Mainnet Blockchain. A total of 2.52 billion NIM were created in the Genesis Block during the Launch of the Mainnet. The minimum unit of NIM is called a satoshi and 100,000 satoshis equal 1 NIM. After the Launch of the Mainnet, NIM are rewarded to miners as described below in the technical section of this FAQ.\n"

         "question": "If I open a Nimiq Ecosystem Application in different browsers will I get different Wallets?",
         "answer": "Yes, each time you open Nimiq Applications with a new browser, created wallets (Private/Public keys) will be stored locally in that browser. In the Nimiq Safe, wallets can be imported and exported, thus, can be exported from one into another browser. If using a Ledger Nano S, the keys are stored on the Ledger and the device can directly be used on multiple computers/browsers without the need to export the keys.\n"

         "answer": "The Nimiq Safe is a free and open-source, client-side user interface. It allows you to interact directly with the Nimiq blockchain while remaining in full control of your keys and your funds. You and only you are responsible for your security.\n"

         "answer": "Make a backup of your 24 Recovery Words and Pass Phrase. Do NOT just store them on your computer. Print or write them down on a piece of paper. Store one ore more copies of this paper in one or more secure and private physical locations. A backup is not useful if it is destroyed by a fire or flood along with your laptop. Do not store your recovery words in Dropbox, Google Drive, or other cloud storage. If such account were to be compromised, your funds will be stolen.\n"

         "question": "Is the balance of my account cleared if I delete my cookies?",
         "answer": "No, the balance of your account is not stored in your browser but in the Nimiq blockchain. The browser only stores the access to the funds for you. This access is stored in the browser offline data. Thus, the access gets only lost when the browser deletes the offline data, not by deleting the cookies. Nonetheless, it's important that your always backup your account access via Account Access File or 24 Recovery Words.\n"

         "question": "Are the Nimiq Account Recovery Words compatible with the Ledger Nano&nbsp;S Recovery Words?",
         "answer": "No, they are not compatible by design. The idea of a hardware wallet is that it prevents access to the private key from the computer, especially from infected computers. Thus, neither the Ledger Nano S Recovery Words should be imported to your computer, nor should the the Recovery Words generated on your computer be imported into the Ledger. If you loose your Ledger Nano S, the recommended way to recover your funds from your Ledger Recovery Words is to import the Ledger Recovery Words into another Ledger Nano S device.\n"

         "question": "How can I get the best setup to mine?",
         "answer": "Nimiq Blockchain uses Argon2 as PoW algorithm. Argon2 was designed and optimized to ensure that GPUs or similar processors won't be able to hash a lot faster than regular CPUs. This is achieved by binding mining speed to memory and cache latency instead of processing power, resulting in reduced power consumption on modern CPUs. The best hardware for mining Argon2 is unknown at this point, as optimized miners have not been developed yet.\n"
